 FINALLY AN ACTUAL ANSWER!! :D

 I had done a bunch of research into this a while ago and filed an issue with the Ubuntu bug tracker, but was told it
 was due to ABI stability (which did not make any sense).

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1894407

 Understanding that there is actually an underlying license problem is like finally being told all of the reasons for
 everything that happened on LOST ;P.

 Might be an unpopular opinion, but there's so many videos focusing on teaching or even teaching methodology for
 learning the language, but then beyond the first 30 minutes covering the absolute basics, almost all beginner to
 intermediate difficulty topics are basically gone. I see this a lot with the posts on this subreddit too. Lots of
 people dipping their feet in the waters, but few reaching the level of proficiency to fully flesh out the ecosystem.

    This is akin to bikesheding (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality). It's easier just to talk the easy
    talk than explore complex scenarios or advanced topics beyond the basics. Most content always will be the same
    regurgitated things you can read on the official docs but only a few will touch real use cases or production ready
    problems.

    Might this not be a problem with any language? I don't quite follow.
    >> 0atman(11) - 2 weeks ago

    There is the, imho excellent, crust of rust series which aims to cover exactly that. But I agree that actually good
    tutorials that ho beyond the basics are sorely lacking.
