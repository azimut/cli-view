 FINALLY AN ACTUAL ANSWER!! :D

 I had done a bunch of research into this a while ago and filed an issue with the Ubuntu bug tracker, but was told it
 was due to ABI stability (which did not make any sense).

 Understanding that there is actually an underlying license problem is like finally being told all of the reasons for
 everything that happened on LOST ;P.
